This is my first real app for mobile for training.

It can currently make a profile. You add your weight, height, age and gender.
Also declare what you want to do with you weight. Gain, lose or maintain.
It will give you the calories you need

You can type in the calories you eat.

You can connect your apple health app and get the steps in there to see how much you burn and how much you then can eat to still be in a deficit.

You can add the exercises you do in the gym.

Currently they are hardcoded with 20 for each bodypart.

And the calories burned doing that exercise is added to the total calories to keep track of everything.

It works best on a Physical IOS Device cause of the connection to apple health app.
